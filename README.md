# Learning Python in 7 Weeks

This repository contains Python exercises and notes from the [7 Week](#) challenge, [JDoodle](https://www.jdoodle.com/python3-programming-online)

## 📚 Week 1: Core Concepts

### ✅ Variables and Expressions
- Explored dynamic typing in Python (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Used `f-strings` for formatted output
- Practiced variable swapping using multiple assignment
- Performed arithmetic and created user input-based logic
- Created real-world output with string interpolation

**Example:**
```python
name = "Monica"
age = 16
target_age = 65
print(f"{name} will reach {target_age} in {target_age - age} years.")
