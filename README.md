### 🚀 **Week 1, Day 1: Variables in Python**

---

### ✅ **What Are Variables?**
Variables are **named storage locations** that hold data. In Python:
- You create a variable by assigning it a value using the `=` operator.  
- Variables are dynamically typed, meaning you don’t need to specify the type when creating them.  
- Python infers the data type based on the value.  

✅ In Python, you can assign multiple variables in a single line, which makes the code cleaner.  

### 💡 **Key Takeaways**
- Python automatically determines the variable’s type.  
- You can use `f-strings` for cleaner string formatting.  
- Variables can hold different data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, and more.

### 🔥 **5 Exercises for You to Practice**

✅ Ran the exercises [JDoodle](https://www.jdoodle.com).  

---

### 🛠️ **Exercise 1: Basic Variables**
Create and print variables representing:
- Your name  
- Your age  
- Your favorite number  
- Whether you enjoy coding (`True` or `False`)  

---

### 🛠️ **Exercise 2: Swapping Variables**
Create two variables: `a = 10` and `b = 20`.  
Swap their values **without using a third variable**.  
✅ Hint: Use Python’s multiple assignment feature.  

---

### 🛠️ **Exercise 3: Simple Math Operations**
Create three variables:
- `num1 = 15`  
- `num2 = 7`  
- `num3 = 2.5`  

Calculate and print:  
- The sum of all three  
- The product of all three  
- The average of all three  

---

### 🛠️ **Exercise 4: Real-World Problem**
Create variables to store the following:  
- The **name of a product**  
- Its **price**  
- The **quantity** purchased  
- Calculate and print the **total cost** (price × quantity).  

---

### 🛠️ **Exercise 5: Bonus Challenge**
Write a program that:  
- Accepts a user’s **name** and **age** as input.  
- Calculates how many years until they turn **100**.  
- Prints: `Hello <name>, you will turn 100 in <X> years.`
